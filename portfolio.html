    <h1>A Guide to Vault Treasure Hunting</h1>
      <h3>For this project we created a game. This game includes 3 levels all with different patterns that the player has to guess. After choosing the level the player wants to play, they choose their first movement, forward, left or right. If they choose the correct movement they move in the specified direction and get to choose another movement. If they do not choose the correct movement, their turtle turns red and goes back to the start. The turtle then turns back to black and the player has to restart the pattern. The goal is to get to the finish line by guessing the correct pattern. If the player reaches the finish line, their turtle turns green. <h3>
