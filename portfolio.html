    <h1>A Guide to Vault Treasure Hunting</h1>
      <h3>For this project we created a game. This game includes 3 levels all with different patterns that the player has to guess. After choosing the level the player wants to play, they choose their first movement, forward, left or right. If they choose the correct movement they move in the specified direction and get to choose another movement. If they do not choose the correct movement, their turtle turns red and goes back to the start. The turtle then turns back to black and the player has to restart the pattern. The goal is to get to the finish line by guessing the correct pattern. If the player reaches the finish line, their turtle turns green. <h3>

    <h1>3-Player Draw</h1>
	<h3>For this project, we had to create another game. This game includes two players competing against one another to draw the best drawing using arrows or aswd keys (they also can use other keys to put the pen up or down). The color and topic of drawing are chosen by the judge. After 45 seconds of drawing, the judge picks their favorite drawing and awards a point to winner. The players can play up to 6 rounds and once they decide to end the game, the computer will announce the winner.</h3>
